=== Lab 103: Distribute network bandwidth fairly

The customer's use case is closely resembles the OptaPlanner example CloudBalancing.
But there are differences:

* The computers are already bought, so we might as well use them all
* All computers have the same network bandwidth.
* The network bandwidth should be load balanced (= distributed fairly) across all computers.

==== Preparation

. Import as a new project in your favorite IDE: `optaplanner-training-lab103/pom.xml`
. Create a new run configuration:
.. Main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.app.CloudBalancingApp`
.. VM parameters (optional): `-Xmx512M -server`
.. Working directory: `optaplanner-training-lab101` (this is the directory that contains the directory `data`)
. Run the run configuration.
.. _Quick open_ `100computer-300processes.xml`, _solve_ it and _terminate solving early_ after about 20 seconds.
.. Notice how the used network bandwidth heavily differs per computer (and that capacity clearly limits it):

.. Leave this window open to compare it later with your modified version.

==== Assignment

. Remove the hard constraint `requiredNetworkBandwidthTotal`
. Remove the soft constraint `computerCost`
. Add a new soft constraint: The network bandwidth used per computer should be as equal as possible (evenly distributed).

NOTE: The GUI will still show the network bandwidth capacity per computer and color it red. Just ignore that.

==== Success criteria

. _Open_ and _solve_ `100computer-300processes.xml`.
+
image::lab103_cloudBalancing_100computers-300processes.png[]
.. It must be feasible (`0hard`).
.. All computers must be used.
.. The total network bandwidth used per computer must be close to each other,
except if the computer has a single process which uses far more network bandwidth.
. Compare the results with the old window.

==== Tips

* Remove 2 score rules and add a new score rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`. No other files require changes.
* Read up about http://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#fairnessScoreConstraints[fairness score constraints].
* There is no law which says that a score (hard or soft) should converge to 0.

==== Solution

===== Implementation

. In the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`, remove the rules `requiredNetworkBandwidthTotal` and `computerCost`.

. Add this rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`:
+
[source,drl]
----
rule "distributeNetworkBandwidthFairly"
    when
        $computer : CloudComputer()
        accumulate(
            CloudProcess(
                computer == $computer,
                $requiredNetworkBandwidth : requiredNetworkBandwidth);
            $total : sum($requiredNetworkBandwidth)
        )
    then
        scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, - ($total * $total));
end
