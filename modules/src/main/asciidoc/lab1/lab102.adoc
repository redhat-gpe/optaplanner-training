=== Lab 102: No process should hog half the CPU power

The customer's use case is closely resembles the OptaPlanner example CloudBalancing.
But there's 1 big difference:

* Don't let a process hog half the CPU power of a computer (unless the computer doesn't have much CPU).

==== Preparation

. Import as a new project in your favorite IDE: `optaplanner-training-lab102/pom.xml`
. Create a new run configuration:
.. Main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.app.CloudBalancingApp`
.. VM parameters (optional): `-Xmx512M -server`
.. Working directory: `optaplanner-training-lab102` (this is the directory that contains the directory `data`)
. Run the run configuration.
.. _Quick open_ `4computer-12processes.xml`, _solve_ it and _terminate solving early_ after about 20 seconds.
.. Click on the button _Details_ of computer 3 to find out which process id's are assigned to it.
.. Notice how process 9 hogs 87.5% of the CPU of computer 3:

.. Leave this window open to compare it later with your modified version.

==== Assignment

. A process is hogging the CPU of a computer if it requires more than half of the computer's CPU power.
.. Exception: A computer with `6` CPU or less is never considered hogged.
. Add a new hard constraint: no process should hog the CPU of a computer.
. The customer has decided that they want the hogging implementation formula in Java, not in DRL.
.. But the constraint itself should be in DRL.

==== Success criteria

. _Open_ and _solve_ `4computer-12processes.xml`. It should no longer assign process 9 to computer 3:
+
image::lab102_cloudBalancing_4computers-12processes.png[]
.. It must be feasible (`0hard`).
.. Process 5 is (probably) still assigned to computer 1 and 2, because those computers have `6` CPU.
. _Open_ and _solve_ `100computer-300processes.xml`, in both the old and the new window. Compare the results.
.. Both solutions should become feasible (`0hard`).
.. The old window's soft score is probably better because it has more flexibility.

==== Tips

* Add a new Java method that checks if a process is hogging its computer.
* Add a new score rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl` and reuse that method.

==== Solution

===== Imperfect implementation

. Add this method in the file `CloudProcess.java`:
+
[source,java]
----
    public boolean isHoggingCpuPower() {
        if (computer == null || computer.getCpuPower() <= 6) {
            return false;
        }
        return requiredCpuPower * 2 > computer.getCpuPower();
    }
----

. Add this rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`:
+
[source,drl]
----
rule "hoggingCpuPower"
    when
        CloudProcess(hoggingCpuPower == true)
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);
end
----

NOTE: That code might trigger a http://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#scoreTrap[score trap].

===== Correct implementation

This code does not trigger that http://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#scoreTrap[score trap]:

. Add these 2 methods in the file `CloudProcess.java`:
+
[source,java]
----
    public boolean isHoggingCpuPower() {
        if (computer == null || computer.getCpuPower() <= 6) {
            return false;
        }
        return requiredCpuPower * 2 > computer.getCpuPower();
    }

    public int getHoggingCpuPowerAmount() {
        if (!isHoggingCpuPower()) {
            return 0;
        }
        return requiredCpuPower * 2 - computer.getCpuPower();
    }
----

. Add this rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`:
+
[source,drl]
----
rule "hoggingCpuPower"
    when
        $p : CloudProcess(hoggingCpuPower == true)
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, - $p.getHoggingCpuPowerAmount());
end
----
