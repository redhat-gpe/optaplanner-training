=== Lab 100: Quick questions

==== Weighting the wishes of nurses

In a hospital nurse rostering use case, we have these constraints:

* *Double shift*: No nurse should work 2 shifts on the same day.
** This is more important than any other constraint, no matter how many times that other constraint is matched.
* *Parenting nurses*: Nurses with children don't want to work on Wednesday afternoon.
* *Young nurses Saturday night*: Young nurses don't want to work on Saturday night.
** This is twice as important as the _Parenting nurses_ constraint.
* *Young nurses Sunday morning*: Young nurses don't want to work on Sunday morning.
** This is a third as important as the _Young nurses Saturday night_ constraint.

Specify the `ScoreDefinitionType` and determine the score weight and level of each constraint.

===== Solution

The `ScoreDefinitionType` is `HARD_SOFT` because we need 2 score levels.
The weight and level for each constraint:

* *Double shift*: `-1hard` for each match
** `scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);`
* *Parenting nurses*: `-3soft` for each match
** `scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, -3);`
* *Young nurses Saturday night*: `-6soft` for each match
** Because `-3soft` times `2` is `-6soft`
** `scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, -6);`
* *Young nurses Sunday morning*: `-2soft` for each match
** Because `-6soft` divided by `3` is `-2soft`
** `scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, -2);`

Any multiple applied to all of the soft or hard numbers is fine too (for example `-30soft;-60soft;-20soft;-1hard`),
but it would increase the likeliness of overflow.

Using decimal or floating point numbers (for example `-1.5soft;-3.0soft;-1.0soft;-1hard`) is a bad idea:

* Decimal numbers (`BigDecimal`) heavily slow down the score calculation.
* Floating point numbers (`double` or `float`) cause http://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#avoidFloatingPointNumbersInScoreCalculation[errors].

==== Weighting the costs of manufacturing jobs

In a manufacturing job shop scheduling use case, we have have these constraints:

* *Machine conflict*: a machine can only process 1 job at a time. (This is physical reality.)
** There can be up to `50 000` jobs and `200` machines.
** Each job takes between `30` seconds and `5` minutes.
** The planning window is `24` hours: a job can start at any time on any machine during that window.
* *Machine cost*: Each machine has a specific power cost per second in dollars.
** Older machines have a higher power cost, newer machines have a smaller power cost.
** The power cost per second is between `1` dollar cent and `10` dollars.
* *Nighttime cost*: Any job starting outside normal working hours (before 8:00 or after 18:00) costs an extra `1` dollar per second.
* *Employee happiness*: Some of the machines are labor intensive or clumsy to work with. Minimize the time they have to work with those.
** The company values profit exclusively over employee happiness. It doesn't believe that employee retention has an impact on profit.

Specify the `ScoreDefinitionType` and determine the score weight and level of each constraint.

[.solution]
===== Solution

The `ScoreDefinitionType` is `HARD_MEDIUM_SOFT_LONG` because we need 3 score levels and to avoid overflow.
The weight and level for each constraint:

* *Machine conflict*: `-1hard` per second that the jobs conflict
** `scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, - job1.conflictingDurationWith(job2));`
* *Machine cost*: `-1medium` per dollar cent of machine power cost and per second of job duration
** `scoreHolder.addMediumConstraintMatch(kcontext, - machine.getPowerCostInDollarCent() * job.getDurationInSeconds());`
* *Nighttime cost*: `-100medium` per second of job duration
** Because the medium score level represents dollar cents, not dollars.
** `scoreHolder.addMediumConstraintMatch(kcontext, -100 * job.getDurationInSeconds());`
* *Employee happiness*: `-1soft` per second of job duration
** Soft because the company prioritizes an extra profit of 1 dollar cent, even if that makes all its employees unhappy.
*** Note: Most companies do realize that employee retention impact profit: they factor in employee unhappiness by putting a price tag on it.
** `scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, - job.getDurationInSeconds());`

It uses 3 score levels:

* Hard: constraints of the universe
* Medium: profit (currently it only contains expenses, so it's a negative number)
* Soft: employee happiness

It requires to the use of `long` numbers instead of `int` (at least for the medium level), to avoid overflow:

. There are `50 000` jobs.
. Each job has a maximum duration of `5` minutes (or `300` seconds).
** This totals up to a maximum of `15 000 000` seconds to pay for.
. Each machine cost up `10` dollars (or `1000` dollar cents) per used second.
** This totals up to a maximum cost of `15 000 000 000` dollar cents (without even taking the nighttime cost in account), which needs to fit in the medium score level.
** The maximum `int` value is only `2 147 483 647`: the medium score level would overflow, so it needs to use a `long` instead.
